<p align="center">A tool for jointly phasing small, structural, and tandem repeat variants for PacBio sequencing data</p>

***

HiPhase will phase variant calls made from [PacBio HiFi](https://www.pacb.com/technology/hifi-sequencing/) datasets.
Key features relative to other phasing tools include:

* Joint phasing of small variants and structural variants
* Support for multi-allelic variation
* Creates [longer, correct phase blocks](docs/performance.md#summary-figure) relative to the current best practice
* No downsampling of the data
* [Novel algorithms](docs/methods.md): dual-mode allele assignment and core A* phasing algorithm
* Quality of life additions: innate multi-threading, simultaneous haplotagging and statistics generation
